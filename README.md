# 🫀 The Framingham Heart Study – Cholesterol & CHD Risk

This project analyzes data from the Framingham Heart Study to explore the relationship between cholesterol levels and the 10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).

## 🧠 Objective
To investigate if high cholesterol levels are associated with increased CHD risk using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing.

## 🔬 Methodology
- **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values in key variables like cholesterol, BMI, and heart rate.
- **EDA:** Examined distributions, correlations, and patterns across blood pressure, age, smoking habits, and cholesterol levels.
- **Risk Segmentation:** Created categories for cholesterol levels and compared CHD prevalence.
- **Visualization:** Used heatmaps, bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots for insight generation.

## 📊 Key Findings
- Individuals with high cholesterol have a **significantly higher proportion of CHD** (16.4%) than those with normal cholesterol (10.5%).
- Elevated systolic blood pressure correlates with higher cholesterol.
- Prevalent hypertension is associated with increased cholesterol levels.
